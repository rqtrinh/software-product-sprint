      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>My name is Ryan Trinh. I am a third year Computer Science major
          at Cal Poly Pomona. My goal is to become a full stack developer 
          after graduating from University. I am looking for opportunties
          to expand and improve my current skill set. As of right now, 
          I am well versed with Java, Python, Data Structures, and OOP.
          I am also trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript which will 
          be used for creating this portfolio.
      </p>
      <h2>Experiences</h2>
      <p>I have had many experiences in my career. My first experience was 
          working as a Back End Developer at the Northrop Grumman Collaboration
          Project. In this project, I created a program that read input controls 
          from either a keyboard or controller. I then formatted the data into a 
          JSON file with floating point values for directional attributes and 
          buttons. The file was then sent to a UGV for use. During this summer, 
          I am currently participating in the Google SPS program. I am also
          interning at Avanade as a Full Stack Developer.
      </p>
      <h2>What makes me me!</h2>
      <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy spending time outside. I like to play tennis, 
          as this was my main sport growing up. However, I have tried to pick up 
          basketball recently. My favourite food is sushi and my favourite drink 
          is orange juice!
