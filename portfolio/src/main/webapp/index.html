      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>My name is Ryan Trinh. I am a third year Computer Science major
          at Cal Poly Pomona. My goal is to become a full stack developer 
          after graduating from University. I am looking for opportunties
          to expand and improve my current skill set. As of right now, 
          I am well versed with Java, Python, Data Structures, and OOP.
          I am also trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript which will 
          be used for creating this portfolio.
      </p>

      <h2>Experiences</h2>
      <p>I have had many experiences in my career. My first experience was 
          working as a Back End Developer at the Northrop Grumman Collaboration
          Project. In this project, I created a program that read input controls 
          from either a keyboard or controller. I then formatted the data into a 
          JSON file with floating point values for directional attributes and 
          buttons. The file was then sent to a UGV for use. During this summer, 
          I am currently participating in the Google SPS program. I am also
          interning at Avanade as a Full Stack Developer.

      <h2>What makes me me!</h2>
      <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy spending time outside. I like to play tennis, 
          as this was my main sport growing up. However, I have tried to pick up 
          basketball recently. My favourite food is sushi and my favourite drink 
          is orange juice!

      <h2>Why Photography</h2>
      <p>As humans, we have limited memory. We forget moments 
          that we would like to remember. It is a bummer when this happens.
          For this very reason, I enjoy taking photographs. A picture is a 
          reminder of a memory we once had. It is a trigger that
          can help us remember great moments we would have otherwise
          forgotten. If they are stored the right way, photographs can 
          last forever; it can last longer than our lifespan.

        <dt><strong>Tennis</strong></dt>
        <p>One of my hidden talents is tennis. Many people have no idea 
            I play tennis because I don't play as much anymore. I can 
            still play well; I'm just not in my prime anymore. In high 
            school, I won CIF-SS. It was basically the championship
            for all high schools in Southern California. 
        </p>
        <dt><strong>Guitar</strong></dt>
        <p>Another hidden talent I have is guitar. I enjoy playing in my 
            time because it calms me down. The genre of music I 
            like to play is classical. Most of the time I play guitar at
            the end of a long day of work or school.
